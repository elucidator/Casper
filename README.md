# Elucidating Casper

This theme is based on the following Themes:

* [Bentely](https://bitbucket.org/caffein8/bentley)
* [Readium](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/)

I merged the two themes to come op with my own theme. Adjusted to my personal likes.

Since I am not a Frontend developer, those who are will probably comment heavily on this one :-). But please feel free to do so, i am not easily offended.

Please feel free to adapt and change to your own likings, but bugs I would like to know.
